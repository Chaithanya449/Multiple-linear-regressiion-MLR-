This project involved building multiple robust linear regression models to accurately predict the price of used Toyota Corolla cars. The project covers a complete data science workflow, starting with a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), followed by effective outlier treatment, and concluding with model building and validation. Stunning visualizations were produced using Matplotlib and Seaborn to understand data distributions and feature relationships.

The primary goal of this project was to explore the Toyota Corolla dataset and build a reliable regression model to accurately predict car prices based on their features. These predictions are crucial in the automotive market, helping both sellers and buyers make informed, data-driven decisions. By analyzing features like the car's age, mileage, horsepower, and fuel type, the objective was to identify the key factors that influence price and build a model that captures these relationships effectively, ultimately achieving an R-squared value of 87%.
